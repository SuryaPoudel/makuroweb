                            <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event shall inception media and/or their respective officers, directors, trustees, members, managers, employees, agents, identified site sponsors, or representatives (all of the foregoing, collectively, the “inception media parties”) be liable to you for any direct, indirect, consequential, incidental, special, punitive or exemplary damages (including without limitation, damages for loss of personal or business profits, business interruption, loss of personal or business information, or other loss or damage) arising out of or related to these terms or arising out of the access or use, or inability to access or use the site and/or its content, even if they have been advised of the possibility of such damages or if such damages are otherwise foreseeable, and regardless of the nature of the cause of action or theory asserted (e.g., whether in contract, tort or otherwise). Access to, and use of, the site and content is at your own risk and discretion and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your device or computer, or loss of data resulting therefrom. If, notwithstanding the provisions of the terms, any of the inception media parties is found to be liable to you for any damage or loss which arises out of or is in any way connected to your access to or use of the site, the content or otherwise, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the aggregate liability of the inception media parties shall in no event exceed $100 usd. You agree to use your best efforts to mitigate any damages or losses you may suffer in connection with your access to and use of the site and the content.</p>
                            <p>Because some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, parts of the above limitation may not apply to you. In such jurisdictions, the liability of Inception Media shall be limited to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law. Check your local laws for any restrictions or limitations regarding the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages.</p>

                            <p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Inception Media, its affiliates, licensees, vendors, partners, identified Site sponsors, and each of their respective directors, officers, members, managers, employees, agents and representatives from and against any and all claims, actions, losses, damages, liabilities, judgments, settlements, costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs) arising out of or relating to (a) your breach of these Terms or any applicable laws or regulations, (b) your access to or use of the Site and/or the Content, (c) your violation, breach or misappropriation of a third party’s copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, right of privacy, right of publicity, or other intellectual property, proprietary or other right, (d) your tortious acts including, without limitation, defamation, and/or (e) any claims you may raise against third parties relating to third party products or services. We reserve the right to assume, at our expense, the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate with our defense of such claims. If we assume such defense, we will be responsible solely for our legal fees in connection with such defense and all other losses, damages, liabilities, judgments, settlements, costs and expenses shall be your sole responsibility.</p>

Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.
